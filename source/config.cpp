//We should therefore checking it thoroughly

//TODO: SQL transactions by users may also be malicius, we can either:
//*Check each of them to be valid by some check code, and only use a subset of parameters of SQL
// (We can extend it progressively each revision to support more commands)
//*Add trigers to tables that will fire RAISE(ROLLBACK) if the unallowed operation is performed
// Problem with that is that we will overload the SQL operation and a very clever user may use
// a transaction that bypasses the triggers.
